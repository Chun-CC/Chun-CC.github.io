abstract: In this Letter, we introduce a noise reduction (NR) strategy in the off-axis camera-in-the-loop (CITL) optimization for high-quality hologram generation. Our proposal adopts the Gaussian blur in the NR strategy to suppress the high-frequency noise and improve the optimization convergence. A double-hologram generation technique is used to reduce the noise further. The off-axis systemâ€™s aberrations are eliminated by integrating the aberration compensation method as well. Compared with the original CITL method, the image quality of the proposed method is improved by approximately 5.5 dB in the optical experiment.
